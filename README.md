# AI-Wildlife-Detection-and-Geolocation-based-Alert-System
This project implements an AI-driven wildlife monitoring system designed to detect and classify animal species in real-time using YOLOv8. The system was developed using the NTLNP dataset, which includes over 2,000 annotated images of wild animals (e.g., Amur tiger, wild boar), domestic animals (e.g., cows, dogs), and humansâ€”captured during both day and night.

Key Features:
Object Detection with YOLOv8: Achieved 91% training accuracy and 95% validation accuracy across 17 animal and human classes.

Interactive Dashboard: Built with React and Python backend, enabling real-time detection logs, statistics visualization, and manual image uploads.

Geolocation and Alerts: Integrated Leaflet.js for map visualization and Twilio API for sending automated SMS alerts when wildlife is detected in critical zones.

This solution aims to address human-wildlife conflict by providing real-time, location-aware detection and notification, offering practical applications in conservation, agriculture, and rural safety.
